Welcome to Google Photos Clone

It has been deployed on Vercel - https://googlephotosclone.vercel.app/
However, there are some features that will not work due to the cost of deploying my FastAPI

- Upload Image (Uses DeepFace to detect faces and CLIPModel for image embedding)
- Auto Generate Album(Text Embedding and cosine similarity)
- People Tabs (Displays Face Cropped, Name Face)
- Search People by name

To use the above features, you will have to run it locally.
